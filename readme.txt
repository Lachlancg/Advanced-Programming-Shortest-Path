The objective of this ACW is to implement, exercise and assess the performance of data structures that represent a transport network and support route-finding and evaluation.  A network is a collection of nodes and arcs so, in the context of a transport network the nodes will correspond to road/rail junctions; towns/cities/villages; bus/rail stations; air/sea ports, etc., while the network arcs will be road/railroute segments or air corridors/sea lanes as appropriate.
